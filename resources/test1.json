Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts."},{"exact_answer":["transcription","interact","c-terminal","activate","-lrb-"],"id":"58dcb47c8acda34529000020","ideal_answer":"transcription"},{"exact_answer":"yes","id":"58dd2cb08acda34529000029","ideal_answer":"yes"},{"exact_answer":["-lrb-","-rrb-","td","antipsychotic","movement"],"id":"58efa36d70f9fc6f0f000004","ideal_answer":"-lrb-"},{"exact_answer":["dysplasia","-lrb-","adrenal","hypoplasia","-rrb-"],"id":"5895e4637d9090f353000012","ideal_answer":"dysplasia"},{"exact_answer":["-rrb-","=","-lrb-","association","fcgr2a"],"id":"58e7a1393e8b6dc87c00000b","ideal_answer":"-rrb-"},{"exact_answer":["sscprofiler","mirna","%","tool","candidate"],"id":"5895f18ce370baff39000001","ideal_answer":"sscprofiler"},{"exact_answer":"yes","id":"58dcbb8c8acda34529000021","ideal_answer":"yes"},{"exact_answer":"yes","id":"58f3cd1470f9fc6f0f00000e","ideal_answer":"yes"},{"id":"58efa66070f9fc6f0f000005","ideal_answer":" We report for the first time, in a typical risk US clinical population, a lack of protective association of aspirin for polyps among active smokers.
